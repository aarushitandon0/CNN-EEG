# EEG-Based Cognitive Workload Classification using CNN 

This project explores cognitive workload classification using EEG signals and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). It utilizes real EEG data recorded during mental arithmetic tasks, sourced from the PhysioNet repository. The objective is to distinguish between **high** and **low** mental workload based on brain activity.
